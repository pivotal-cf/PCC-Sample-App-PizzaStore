 * This class runs the sample pizza store application.
 * This is a Pivotal Cloud Cache (PCC) client application which interacts with a PCC service instance
 * or a GemFire cluster.
 *
 * The configuration classes are defined under the config package.
 * The apis exposed by the client application are defined in AppController class.
 *
 * This application can talk to a TLS enabled PCC service instance or a non-TLS PCC service instance (SI).
 * Staring this application with spring.profiles.active=tls will enable TLS communication (needs TLS enabled
 * service instance).
